## 🎓 Project Background: BHCC Academic Contribution

This project was developed as part of **PROJECT 6: ETHICAL HACKING** under the **CIT-113-01 - Info Tech Problem Solving** course at **Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC)** during the Spring 2025 semester. The course emphasizes:

- Real-world problem solving through technology  
- Ethical use of AI and digital tools  
- Project-based learning (PBL) with a focus on communication, teamwork, and user impact  
- Building digital fluency across word processing, spreadsheets, and presentation software  

> 💬 *"The goal isn’t just to code — it's to create something meaningful, solve real problems, and present ideas clearly."*

This project aligns with several core learning outcomes of the course:

- Apply automation to improve productivity and reduce repetitive tasks  
- Use Python and GUI tools for digital communication  
- Create effective digital presentations using programmatically generated media  
- Reflect on the ethical use of information and tools in problem-solving  
- Demonstrate curiosity, initiative, and independent development in a structured, collaborative learning environment  

It serves as both a technical tool and a creative expression of problem-solving — showcasing how programming can make knowledge sharing more efficient and engaging.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to make presentation creation fast, consistent, and error-free — especially in academic or technical environments. PowerPoint Generator is built to remove repetitive tasks, enforce consistency, and let you focus on the **message, not the medium**.

It reflects my interest in:

* Automation  
* UI simplicity  
* Communication tools that scale  
* Making tech accessible for non-technical users  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* `Python 3.11+`  
* `python-pptx` (for slide generation)  
* `Tkinter` (for GUI)  
* `lxml` (XML handling in .pptx)  
* `PyInstaller` (for `.exe` packaging)  

Optional:  
* `pyautogui` — for GUI enhancements or automated actions
